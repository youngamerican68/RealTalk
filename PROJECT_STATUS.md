# RealTalk Draft - Project Status & Strategic Transformation

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Product**: Crisis communication and reputation protection Chrome extension  
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL - DUAL-MODE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Latest Fix**: ✅ Both Simple Mode and Expert Mode now properly rewrite messages (fixed AI prompt issues)  

## 🔧 **RECENT BREAKTHROUGH - DUAL-MODE FUNCTIONALITY PERFECTED**

### 🎯 **August 14, 2025 - Critical Fix Applied**
**Problem Solved**: AI was generating responses TO messages instead of rewriting the messages themselves  
**Root Cause**: Expert Mode scenario prompts used confusing terminology like "crisis management responses"  
**Solution**: Updated all Expert Mode prompts to use same "Transform this message" language as working Simple Mode  

### ✅ **Confirmed Working Examples**
```
Input: "if you dont finish your sandwich, im calling your mom"

✅ Simple Mode (Friendly): "I noticed you didn't finish your sandwich. How about we save it for later?"
✅ Expert Mode (Crisis Response): "I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble finishing your sandwich. I'd like to find a solution that works for everyone."
✅ Expert Mode (Professional Pushback): Generates assertive but professional versions
✅ Expert Mode (De-escalation): Generates calmer, more diplomatic versions

❌ OLD BROKEN: "I appreciate your concern about my lunch, but I believe I can manage my own meals..."
```
